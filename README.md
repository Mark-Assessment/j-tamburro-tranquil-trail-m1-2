# Tranquil-Trail Wellness
For my Milestone Project 1 in L5 Web Application Development, I have designed and created a website called Tranquil-Trail Wellness. This website has been created with the intention of a social walking group being immersed in nature for the purpose of focusing on health and wellbeing, as well as making new connections with like-minded people. This website has been developed in such a way that it should be easy for users to navigate, as well as being fully accessible and responsive, covering a range of different devices.

# Design

## Colour Scheme

The two main colours I have used across my website are:

- **Green**
  - Hex Code: #466043
  - Example: ![Green](https://via.placeholder.com/15/466043/000000?text=+)
  - Description: Represents nature, tranquility and a sense of calm.

- **Brown**
  - Hex Code: #A0522D
  - Example: ![Brown](https://via.placeholder.com/15/A0522D/000000?text=+)
  - Description: Symbolizes earthiness and warmth.

I have chosen these two colours as I feel they represent nature well, and therefore fit in with my website's theme.

I have also used:

- **White**
  - Hex Code: #FFFFFF
  - Example: ![White](https://via.placeholder.com/15/FFFFFF/000000?text=+)
  - Description: Used for text on my submit button to ensure readability against the background colours.
