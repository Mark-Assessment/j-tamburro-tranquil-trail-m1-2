For my Milestone Project 1 in L5 Web Application Development, I have designed and created a website called Tranquil-Trail Wellness. This website has been created with the intention of a social walking group being immersed in nature for the purpose of focusing on health and wellbeing, as well as making new connections with like-minded people. This website has been developed in such a way that it should be easy for users to navigate, as well as being fully accessible and responsive, covering a range of different devices.

# Design

## Colour Scheme

The two main colours I have used across my website are:

- **Green**
![Green](https://via.placeholder.com/15/466043/000000?text=+)

  - Hex Code: #466043
  - Represents nature, tranquility and a sense of calm.

- **Brown**

![Brown](https://via.placeholder.com/15/A0522D/000000?text=+)
  - Hex Code: #A0522D
  - Symbolizes earthiness and warmth.

I have chosen these two colours as I feel they represent nature well, and therefore fit in with the website's theme.

I have also used:

- **White**
  - Hex Code: #FFFFFF
  - Used for text on the submit button to ensure readability against the background colours.

  ## Typography

  I have used the font "Josefin Slab" as the main font throughout the site, with a fall back font of "serif" for easy readability. I have chosen this font because it's soft, and blends with the nature theme well. I have used <a href="https://fonts.google.com">Google Fonts</a> for this.

  ## Imagery

  This website displays a background image showing a photo of a walking group out in nature. It sets the background to a natural lovely green hue which adds to the calming feel, purpose and aim of what the website is for in the first place. The blue sky of the photo is perfectly in line with the navbar and logo, which automatically separates it from the rest of the site.

# Features

## Navbar

### Navigation 

- The Navbar is positioned at the top of each page.
- The Navbar contains the logo on the left-hand side.
- The Navbar contains the menu which is slightly off-centre, to the left.

It is easy to read and offers clear navigation.

The Navbar menu contains:

- **Home** - This is the default page, describing to users what the website is about.

- **Benefits** - This is the second page, where users can read about the health benefits.

- **Gallery** - This is the third page, where users can view six different photos.

- **Sign Up** - This is the fourth page, which contains a sign-up form requiring First Name, Last Name and Email Address, along with a selection of four different choices of locations and a submit button. Underneath the sign-up form are two testimonials, each with a picture of the person.

The links include an animated hover effect, which have the font colour of ![Green](https://via.placeholder.com/15/466043/000000?text=+) #466043 and then changes to ![Brown](https://via.placeholder.com/15/A0522D/000000?text=+) #A0522D upon hovering.

The Navigation is responsive across all devices.

## Benefits

The Benefits features include:

- A quote at the top of the page.
- A list of health benefits of spending time in nature, with a lotus flower icon next to each list item for added visual effect and warmth. The icon is brown to symbolise the soil and to contrast the green of the body nicely.
