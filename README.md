For my Milestone Project 1 in L5 Web Application Development, I have designed and created a website called Tranquil-Trail Wellness. This website has been created with the intention of a social walking group being immersed in nature for the purpose of focusing on health and wellbeing, as well as making new connections with like-minded people. This website has been developed in such a way that it should be easy for users to navigate, as well as being fully accessible and responsive, covering a range of different devices.

# Design

## Colour Scheme

The two main colours I have used across my website are:

- **Green**
![Green](https://via.placeholder.com/15/466043/000000?text=+)

  - Hex Code: #466043
  - Represents nature, tranquility and a sense of calm.

- **Brown**
![Brown](https://via.placeholder.com/15/A0522D/000000?text=+)

  - Hex Code: #A0522D
  - Symbolizes earthiness and warmth.

I have chosen these two colours as they represent nature well, and therefore fit in with the website's theme.

I have also used:

- **White**
  - Hex Code: #FFFFFF
  - Used for text on the submit button to ensure readability against the background colours.

  ## Typography

  I have used the font "Josefin Slab" as the main font throughout the site, with a fall back font of "serif" for easy readability. I have chosen this font because it's soft, and blends with the nature theme well. I have used <a href="https://fonts.google.com">Google Fonts</a> for this.

  ## Imagery

  This website displays a background image showing a photo of a walking group out in nature. It sets the background to a natural lovely green hue which adds to the calming feel, purpose and aim of what the website is for in the first place. The blue sky of the photo is perfectly in line with the navbar and logo, which automatically separates it from the rest of the site. It displays different parts of the photo on each page, with a transparent overlay of a variety of different containers.
