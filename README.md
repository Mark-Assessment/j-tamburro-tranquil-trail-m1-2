# Tranquil-Trail Wellness
For my Milestone Project 1 in L5 Web Application Development, I have designed and created a website called Tranquil-Trail Wellness. This website has been created with the intention of a social walking group being immersed in nature for the purpose of focusing on health and wellbeing, as well as making new connections with like-minded people. This website has been developed in such a way that it should be easy for users to navigate, as well as being fully accessible and responsive, covering a range of different devices.
## User Experience - UX

# Design

## Colour Scheme

The two main colours I have used across my website are:

## Green
- Hex Code #466043 
- Example: <span style="color:#466043, background-color=#466043;">

## Brown
- Hex Code #A0522D
- Example: <span style="color=#A0522D, background-color=#A0522D;">

I have chosen these two colours as I feel they represent nature well, and therefore fit in with my website's theme.

I have also used 

## White
- Hex Code #FFFFFF
- Example: <span style="color=#FFFFFF; background-color=#FFFFFF;">

I have used white for the text on my submit button as it shows up nicely against the green and the brown.
