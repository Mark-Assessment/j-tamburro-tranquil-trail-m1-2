## Advanced Testing

Testing has been completed in a variety of ways:

 ### Browsers
 
 I have tested the website on three different browers. All three browsers display all pages of the website as it should. Each page of the website looks identical on all three browsers. The submit button works and all internal and externals link also work. 
  - Google Chrome
  - Microsoft Edge
  - Brave

  ### User Feedback

  Friends and family have tested my website on different devices and browsers and the feedback has been that the website is responsive, accessible, easy to navigate, clear and concise. All internal and external links and buttons also work.

 ### Online responsive tools

 I have used online responsive tools to show what my website looks like on a range of different devices. Below is a screenshot which shows my website as it would be seen on the following devices:
  - iPhone XS, X 375x812
  - Galaxy S9 Plus, S8 Plus 412x846
  - Galaxy S9, Note 8, S8 360x740
  - Medium Screen 1024x800

### Online Validation Sites

I have tested my website by running all pages of my HTML and my CSS code through the following online validation sites:

- The W3C MarkUp Validation Service
- The W3C CSS Validation Service - Jigsaw

**The W3C MarkUp Validation Service**

The W3C MarkUp Validation Service found errors in my HTML code. These errors are documented in the below screenshots: 

- Home Page:

[Home-Page-Error2](/testing/errors/HTML%20error%201.png)

[Home-Page-Error3](/testing/errors/HTML%20error%201.0.png)

- Benefits Page:

[Benefits-Page-Error2](/testing/errors/benefits.html%20errors%201.png)

[Benefits-Page-Error3](/testing/errors/benefits.html%20errors%201.0.png)

[Benefits-Page-Error4](/testing/errors/benefits.html%20errors%201.1.png)

[Benefits-Page-Error5](/testing/errors/benefits.html%20errors%201.2.png)

[Benefits-Page-Error6](/testing/errors/benefits.html%20errors%201.3.png)

[Benefits-Page-Error7](/testing/errors/benefits.html%20errors%201.4.png)

[Benefits-Page-Error9](/testing/errors/benefits.html%20errors%201.6.png)

[Benefits-Page-Error10](/testing/errors/benefits.html%20errors%201.7.png)

- Gallery Page:

[Gallery-Page-Error](/testing/errors/gallery.html%20errors.png)

- Sign-Up Page:

[Sign-Up-Page1](/testing/errors/signup.html%20errors.png)

[Sign-Up-Page2](/testing/errors/signup.html%20errors%201.png)

[Sign-Up-Page3](/testing/errors/signup.html%20errors%201.1.png)

- Extra Page:

[Extra-Page](/testing/errors/extra.html%20error.png)


I fixed these errors and then ran each page through the validator again, which produced the following results:

- Home Page:

![Home-Page-Fixed](/testing/errors/index.html%20error%20complete.png)

- Benefits Page:

![Benefits-Page-Fixed](/testing/errors/benefits.html%20error%20complete.png)

- Gallery Page:

![Gallery-Page-Fixed](/testing/errors/gallery.html%20error%20complete.png)

- Sign-Up Page:

![Sign-Up-Page-Fixed](/testing/errors/signup.html%20error%20complete.png)

- Extra Page:

![Extra-Page-Fixed](/testing/errors/extra.html%20error%20complete.png)

This showed that my errors were fixed and there were no further errors in my code.

I will refer to the below screenshot, that does raise a query but isn't classed as an error. I tried all different ways of changing the wording, but it didn't change the message I received. This was tagged onto the images that are in the screenshots above.

**The W3C CSS Validation Service - Jigsaw**

The W3C CSS Validation Service - Jigsaw found two errors in my CSS code. These errors are documented in the below screenshot:

![CSS-Error](/testing/errors/w3c%20css%20jigsaw%20validator%20results.png)

I fixed these two errors and then ran my CSS code through the validator again, which produced the following result:

# Performance Results

I ran my site through both Lighthouse and Google Page-Speed Services and got the following results for both desktop and mobile devices:

## Lighthouse

- Desktop

![Lighthouse-Desktop](/testing/errors/Desktop%20performance%20lighthouse.png)

- Mobile

![Lighthouse-Mobile](/testing/errors/Mobile%20performance%20lighthouse.png)

## Google Page-Speed Services

- Desktop

![Google-Desktop](/testing/errors/Desktop%20performance.png)

- Mobile

![Google-Mobile](/testing/errors/Mobile%20performance.png)

This showed me that my website is running well and that it meets expected standards for mobile and desktop.

## WAVE - Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools

I also ran my website through WAVE to find out how accessible it is for those that are visually-impaired. The results are below:

![WAVE1](/testing/errors/Wave%20results.png)
![WAVE2](/testing/errors/Wave%20results1.png)

This showed me that my website is accessible and fairly easy for visually-impaired users to navigate.

# Bugs

I encountered three bugs regarding responsiveness. These are detailed in the screenshots below:

- iPhone XR
I became aware of this issue when testing the website on my iPhone XR. The site worked well, except for this issue. It has become apparent through user feedback that this is a small issue on most mobile devices. I tried changing/adding/removing various bits of code to try and fix this to get it to work but found that I couldn't get it to work.

- iPad
The navigation bar does not display in a visually-appealing way on some tablet devices. I also tried to fix this, but couldn't get it to work.

# Mistakes

- I made the mistake early on in my project of using lowercase letters when using git commands. This was something I very quickly learnt not to do and since then have ensured that all other git commands are written beginning with a capital letter.

- I would sometimes get a little muddled on writing the correct command when using git add. All files have gone into the right folders despite this.
